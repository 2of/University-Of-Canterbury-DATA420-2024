 Jupyter Notebooks for Big Data Computing @ UC 2024


As these notebooks don't come with the requisite datasets; expect them to be broken in some capacity. 

### Assignment 1:
        Precipitation data is not supplied; it totalled, from memory around 3B rows.

        Ipynb and reports included.

        Chloropeth.py simply generates from a .csv


### Assignment 2:

        Million song dataset analysis and recommendations, google for the dataset :)
